# LeetcodePrep

Welcome to **LeetcodePrep**, a repository dedicated to helping you prepare for coding interviews by solving LeetCode problems. This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by topic and difficulty, along with explanations to enhance your understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured approach to mastering LeetCode problems, which are commonly used in technical interviews at top tech companies. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, this repository aims to help you:
- Understand key algorithmic concepts.
- Practice problem-solving with well-documented solutions.
- Prepare effectively for coding interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to make it easy to navigate through problems and solutions:

```
LeetcodePrep/
â”œâ”€â”€ Arrays/
â”œâ”€â”€ LinkedLists/
â”œâ”€â”€ Trees/
â”œâ”€â”€ DynamicProgramming/
â”œâ”€â”€ Graphs/
â”œâ”€â”€ SortingAndSearching/
â”œâ”€â”€ Others/
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- Each folder corresponds to a specific category of problems (e.g., Arrays, LinkedLists, etc.).
- Inside each folder, you'll find solutions to LeetCode problems, typically written in **Java**, with clear file names indicating the problem title or number.
- Solutions include:
    - **Code**: Optimized and well-commented code.
    - **Explanation**: A brief description of the approach, time complexity (using Big O notation), and space complexity.
    - **Example**: Sample inputs and outputs for clarity.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/venkatlvs/LeetcodePrep.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Category**:
    - Browse the folders (e.g., `Arrays/`, `DynamicProgramming/`) to find problems related to specific topics.

3. **Study the Solutions**:
    - Open the solution file for a problem (e.g., `TwoSum.java`).
    - Read the explanation to understand the approach and reasoning.
    - Analyze the code and run it locally to test with different inputs.

4. **Practice**:
    - Try solving the problem on LeetCode before looking at the solution.
    - Compare your approach with the provided solution to learn optimization techniques.

5. **Contribute**:
    - If you have an alternative solution or want to add a new problem, feel free to submit a pull request! See the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

## Example Solution

Hereâ€™s an example of how solutions are structured in this repository:

**Problem**: Two Sum (LeetCode #1)  
**File**: `Arrays/TwoSum.java`

```java
/*
 * Problem: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers
 * such that they add up to target.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n) - Using a HashMap to store complements.
 * Space Complexity: O(n) - To store the HashMap.
 */
public class TwoSum {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- We use a HashMap to store each number and its index.
- For each number, we check if its complement (target - number) exists in the HashMap.
- If found, we return the indices; otherwise, we add the current number to the HashMap.

## Big O Notation

All solutions include time and space complexity analysis using Big O notation to help you understand the efficiency of the approach. For example:
- **O(1)**: Constant time (e.g., accessing an array element).
- **O(n)**: Linear time (e.g., iterating through an array).
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time (e.g., binary search).
- **O(nÂ²)**: Quadratic time (e.g., nested loops).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If youâ€™d like to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-solution`).
3. Add your solution or improve existing ones, ensuring:
    - Clear file naming (e.g., `ProblemName.java`).
    - Proper comments and complexity analysis.
    - A brief explanation of the approach.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add solution for Problem X"`).
5. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/new-solution`).
6. Open a pull request with a description of your changes.

Please follow the existing code style and structure for consistency.
